8,AMHS technician,1.0,Awful work environment.,"Where to begin, I supposed how the offer letter you digned is completely invalid and aren't even paid according to any numbers that you may have on the letter. The shifts aren't even correct as the letter states the numbers have built in over time for the days and night shift. That doesn't exist. The lack of acknowledgement from the company on lying to any employee that was hired under the false pretense of the offer letter is baffling. I was sent out for AMHS for advanced training, sounds great but for 5 months we have done nothing but sit at a desk with no hands on learning the same power points we learned in about a week. Training schedule is non existent. Sometimes we go into the fab to train but aren't able to touch any tools due to fab 18 being production. Many times different solutions have been voiced for a different training regimen that could benefit all in taiwan for training. Unfortunately the management do not care about the solutions. If you join this company you better have read you offer letter and then act like it doesn't exist. Good luck. ",,,1,1,1,1,1
