# About
There are two ver. of web scraping that I've created.  

# Codes

### [Get Company Names](https://github.com/stephanie0324/Web-Scraping-/blob/main/indeed/Get_company_names.ipynb)
* This for getting all the alias for the same company on Indeed web, though they represent the same company they have different website (e.g. TSMC 、台積電、台灣積體電路⋯⋯)
* This creates a dictionary to contain all the alias.
* Using the English stock name of the company, can get a more precise result
### [indeed web scrape](https://github.com/stephanie0324/Web-Scraping-/blob/main/indeed/Indeed%20web_scrape.ipynb) 
* Get all the review under the company
