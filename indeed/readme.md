# About
There are two ver. of web scraping that I've created.  

# Codes

### [web_scrape_forall](https://github.com/stephanie0324/Web-Scraping-/blob/main/skytrax/web_scrape_forall.ipynb) 
* This for getting all the reviews from all airlines. 
* All review are collected from the moment you run through the codes.
### [web_crawl_func](https://github.com/stephanie0324/Web-Scraping-/blob/main/skytrax/web_crawl_func.ipynb) 
* This version allows people to get reviews after a specific date, which means that you can flexiblely add new datas to your files without 
having to go through all the reviews every time you want to scrape some infos from the website.
